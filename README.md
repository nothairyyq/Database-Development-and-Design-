### Brief Introduction
This module is designed to provide an understanding of modern database systems for developing and 
managing efficient and effective database applications. On top of studentsâ€™ understanding of Introduction to

enterprise data with popular database systems. The module first emphasizes Relational Database 
Management System (RDBMS), focusing on advanced SQL, query optimization, indexes creation, and 
transactions management. It then focuses on other database types, including object-relational and XML.
Finally, the module concludes with a brief introduction to data warehousing and data mining for analyzing big 
data and its applications in decision making. The practical design of databases and developing database 
applications using modern software tools will be emphasized.
